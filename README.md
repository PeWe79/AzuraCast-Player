# Fully Modified SomaFM Music Player As AzuraCast Player

![SomaFM-Player](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeWe79/somaFm-player-mod/main/thumb.jpg)

This is a Vue.js web application for streaming radio stations from [demo.azuracast.com][azuracast]. This app uses the public SomaFM JSON channels API endpoint to pull in a list of stations and makes it easy to switch between stations. This app also used Three.js and the [HTML5 Web Audio Context API][audioapi] to sample audio data and create a visualizer effect for the selected station.
